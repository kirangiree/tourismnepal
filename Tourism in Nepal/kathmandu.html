There is a famous folk story that narrates the establishment of the Kathmandu Valley. Long ago, during the Pleistocene era, Kathmandu Valley was a vast lake – a beautiful exhibition of aquatic flora and fauna. Around the same era, when Manjushree, a holy Buddhist Saint from Tibet, saw a beautiful lotus flower floating in the center of the lake, boundless admiration started to flame inside his heart, which evoked his devotion to hold and worship the flower.

Chobar Gorge - Where Manjushree drained the Kathmandu Valley

He, then, cut the Chobar Hill which now can be seen as a deep gorge, letting the lake water drain out, leaving a fertile valley for human settlement. Later the settlement became a well-known terminal for diverse people; for devotees (both Hindus and Buddhists), Tibetan and Indian merchants, artisans, emperors, explorers, historians, hippies, according to the respective era, and – now - for tourists from around the world.

The Kathmandu Valley has always been a melting pot of diverse cultures, religions, arts and crafts. The Gopala and Kirat dynasties ruled at the earliest periods, followed by the Licchavi (300-879 AD), who, correspondingly, developed the city with a passion, traditional art, and religious belief. 

Kumari the Living Godess of Kathmandu

The many dynasties that ruled the valley have left a rich legacy in the form of cultural and religious harmony; the varieties of temples of Hinduism and Buddhism that are standing next to each other for centuries, diverse ethnicities, colorful festivals, and celebration. All these can be seen  within walking distance from your hotel in Kathmandu.

The Kathmandu Valley comprises three historic cities - Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur, which were once independent states ruled by Malla kings, who ruled the cities from the 12th to the 18th centuries and competed with each other to glorify their reign by building monuments and temples that showcased the craftsmanship and architectural skills of newar artisans. It was a time when even the mighty Mongol Emporers like Kublai Khan hired exceptional craftsmen from the Kathmandu Valley to glorify their empire.

The famous Pagoda style architecture is a gift from the Kathmandu Valley to China. Now the Kathmandu Valley is home to seven sites which make the valley a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site, a reminder of the golden era in Nepali architecture.
